# Changelog

Every change that ships bumps the version in `samanzavarian-elementor-widgets.php`
(header `Version:` and `SZW_VERSION`, which also busts the asset cache) and adds
an entry here. `tests/process-test.php` fails if the three disagree.

## 0.4.0
- New: **Service Tabs** ("What I do") — a nested widget like Elementor's own Tabs:
  every tab owns a real container, so any content can be built inside it. A new
  widget arrives with the design's four tabs, each holding a Service Panel.
  WAI-ARIA tabs (one tab stop, arrows/Home/End), sliding highlight, links to a
  tab by ID (optionally written to the address), editor sync both ways. Layout
  (list beside / row above) follows Elementor breakpoints; full Style tab.
- New: **Service Panel** — toned background, scene, frosted card with text,
  deliverables and a button (with a contact-form pre-select hint). Scenes for
  the design's four panels (static in this version), or an image/video that
  plays only while visible in an open tab.
- Matches the design to 0px at 1440/1100/860/390 on every tab, also under a
  hostile theme. Kept on purpose: the playhead handle the design defines but
  hides through an unrelated `.ph` rule.
- Tests split into tests/lib.php, plugin-, process- and service-test; run all
  with `wp eval-file tests/all.php`.

## 0.3.0
- Process: separate arrow icons for arrows above and below the cards (widget-wide
  and per step); an empty "below" icon reuses the "above" one.

## 0.2.0
- Process: responsive layout now follows Elementor's breakpoints — tablet/mobile
  values are control defaults (columns 4/2/1, gaps, grid extension); the
  stylesheet's fixed 900px breakpoint is gone.
- Process (mobile): hidden end-of-row arrows no longer cause sideways scrolling;
  one column on phones with arrows pointing down; grid stays inside the screen.
- Process: Arrows section — show/hide per breakpoint, hand-drawn or any icon,
  per-step override (own icon / none); style: colour, weight, size, rotate, offsets.
- Process: optional link per step (whole card becomes a link, keyboard focus styled).

## 0.1.0
- Plugin scaffold, shared design layer, icon library.
- Process Steps widget ("How we work").
